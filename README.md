# SVMs-from-scratch
Support vector machines are a stable of ML classification algorithms. This project aims to implement SVMs from scratch, in c++, and to detail the theory behind them.

## The aim
A support vector machine aims to create a hyperplane (defined by $wx + b$) that separates two sets of data into two labels (+1 or -1) with as large a margin as possible between the two data sets. 
I.e. $y_i = +1 \implies wx + b > 1$ and similarly $y_i = -1 \implies wx + b < -1$. These equations can be combined as: $y_i(wx_i+b) > 1, \forall i$.


In summary:

## Lagrangian multipliers

## The dual problem

## Non-linearly separable data
  
## Solving for $\alpha$ with sequential minimal optimisation
